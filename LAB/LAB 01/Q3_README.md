# Q3 – Finding the Defective Coin Using Divide and Conquer

## Aim
To identify a defective (lighter) coin among a set of coins using the
**divide and conquer technique**.

## Description
This program simulates the classic **defective coin problem** where one coin
has a different (lighter) weight compared to the others.

The coins are divided into two equal halves and their total weights are compared.
Based on the comparison result, the algorithm recursively searches in the lighter half.
If the number of coins is odd, the remaining coin is checked separately.

The approach minimizes the number of comparisons and efficiently locates
the defective coin.

## Algorithm Used
- Divide and Conquer

## Input
- An array representing the weights of coins  
- One coin is assumed to be defective (lighter than others)

## Output
- Index of the defective coin  
- Message indicating if no defective coin is found

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates the efficiency of the divide and conquer approach
in solving the defective coin problem by reducing the number of comparisons
required to identify the faulty coin.
