# Heap Sort – Sorting Using Binary Heap

## Aim
To implement the **Heap Sort algorithm** to sort a given list of elements
in ascending order.

## Description
This program implements the Heap Sort technique using a **max heap**.
The algorithm first builds a max heap from the input array and then repeatedly
extracts the maximum element and places it at the end of the array.

The heap property is maintained using the `heapify` function, ensuring efficient
sorting.

## Algorithm Used
- Heap Sort (using Max Heap)

## Input
- Number of elements `n`
- `n` integer elements

## Output
- The sorted array in ascending order

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: **O(n log n)**
- Average Case: **O(n log n)**
- Worst Case: **O(n log n)**

## Conclusion
Heap Sort is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that does not
require additional memory and guarantees a time complexity of **O(n log n)**,
making it suitable for large datasets.
