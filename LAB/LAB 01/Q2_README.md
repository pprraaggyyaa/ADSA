# Q2 – Binary Search vs Ternary Search

## Aim
To implement **Binary Search** and **Ternary Search** algorithms and compare them
based on the number of comparisons required to search an element in a sorted array.

## Description
This program takes a sorted array and a search key as input.
It performs:
- Binary Search
- Ternary Search

Both algorithms search for the given element and count the number of comparisons
made during the search process.

The results help in understanding the efficiency of Binary Search and Ternary Search
in terms of comparisons.

## Algorithms Used
1. Binary Search
2. Ternary Search

## Input
- Size of the array `n`
- `n` sorted elements
- Element to be searched `x`

## Output
- Index at which the element is found (if present)
- Number of comparisons made by:
  - Binary Search
  - Ternary Search

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates that Binary Search generally requires fewer
comparisons than Ternary Search, making it more efficient for searching
in sorted arrays.
