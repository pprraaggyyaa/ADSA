# Q1 – Comparison of Time Complexity Functions

## Aim
To evaluate and compare different mathematical functions representing time complexities
and arrange them in increasing order for a given value of **n**.

## Description
This program takes an integer value **n** as input and computes the values of various
time complexity functions such as constant, logarithmic, linear, polynomial, and
exponential-like functions.

The program uses:
- Function pointers to store different functions
- Structures to store function names and computed values
- `qsort()` to sort the functions based on their evaluated values

Finally, the functions are printed in increasing order of their computed values.

## Functions Compared
- 1  
- log₂(n)  
- 12√n  
- 50√n  
- n⁰·⁵¹  
- n  
- 3n  
- 232n  
- n log₂n  
- 2n³  
- 100n² + 6n  
- n² − 324  

## Input
- An integer value `n`

## Output
- List of functions arranged in increasing order based on their evaluated values for the given `n`

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
2. Run the executable:

## Conclusion
This experiment helps in understanding how different time complexity functions grow
with respect to input size and how they can be compared numerically.
