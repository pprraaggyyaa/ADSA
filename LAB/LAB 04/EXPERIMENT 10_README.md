# Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication (2×2 Matrices)

## Aim
To implement **Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication algorithm** for multiplying
two **2×2 matrices** efficiently.

## Description
This program demonstrates Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication
specifically for **2×2 matrices**.

Instead of the conventional 8 multiplications, Strassen’s algorithm reduces
the number of multiplications to **7**, thereby improving efficiency.
The algorithm computes seven intermediate products (M1 to M7) and combines
them to form the resultant matrix.

## Algorithm Used
- Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication
- Divide and Conquer

## Input
- Elements of first 2×2 matrix A
- Elements of second 2×2 matrix B

## Output
- Resultant matrix C = A × B

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Time Complexity
- **O(1)** for fixed 2×2 matrices  
- Conceptually follows **O(n^log₂7)** for larger matrices

## Applications
- Matrix multiplication concepts
- Basis for fast matrix multiplication algorithms
- Computer graphics and numerical computations

## Conclusion
Strassen’s algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required for
matrix multiplication. This program demonstrates the working of the algorithm
clearly using a 2×2 matrix example.
