# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

## Aim
To find the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** between two given strings
using **Dynamic Programming** and to display all possible common subsequences.

## Description
This program takes two input strings and computes the length of their
Longest Common Subsequence using a dynamic programming approach.

A DP table is constructed to store intermediate results, which helps in:
- Finding the length of the LCS
- Reconstructing the LCS string

Additionally, the program uses recursion to print all possible common
subsequences between the two strings.

## Algorithm Used
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion

## Input
- First string
- Second string

## Output
- Length of the Longest Common Subsequence
- The LCS string
- All possible common subsequences

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Time Complexity
- LCS computation: **O(m × n)**  
where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings.

## Applications
- DNA sequence analysis
- File comparison tools
- Version control systems

## Conclusion
The dynamic programming approach efficiently computes the Longest Common
Subsequence and helps in identifying similarities between two strings.
