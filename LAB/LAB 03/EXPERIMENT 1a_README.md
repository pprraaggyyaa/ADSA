# Binary Search Using Iterative and Recursive Methods

## Aim
To implement **Binary Search** using both **iterative** and **recursive**
approaches and search for a given element in a sorted array.

## Description
This program performs Binary Search on a sorted array in two ways:
1. **Iterative Binary Search**
2. **Recursive Binary Search**

Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
If the target element is less than the middle element, the search continues
in the left subarray; otherwise, it continues in the right subarray.

## Algorithms Used
- Iterative Binary Search
- Recursive Binary Search

## Input
- Number of elements `n`
- `n` sorted array elements
- Element to be searched (`key`)

## Output
- Index of the element if found
- Message indicating if the element is not found
- Results for both iterative and recursive methods

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: **O(1)**
- Average Case: **O(log n)**
- Worst Case: **O(log n)**

## Applications
- Searching in sorted data
- Database indexing
- Efficient lookup operations

## Conclusion
Binary Search is an efficient searching technique for sorted arrays.
Both iterative and recursive approaches produce the same result, with
the recursive method using function calls and the iterative method using loops.
