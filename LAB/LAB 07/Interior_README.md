# Position of a Point with Respect to a Circle

## Aim
To determine whether a given point lies **inside**, **on**, or **outside**
a circle.

## Description
This program takes the center `(h, k)` and radius `r` of a circle as input.
It also takes the coordinates `(x, y)` of a point.

Using the **distance formula**, the program compares the distance of the point
from the center of the circle with the radius to determine the position of
the point.

## Formula Used
- Distance² = (x − h)² + (y − k)²

Comparison:
- Distance² < r² → Point is **inside** the circle  
- Distance² = r² → Point is **on** the circle  
- Distance² > r² → Point is **outside** the circle  

## Input
- Center of the circle `(h, k)`
- Radius `r`
- Coordinates of the point `(x, y)`

## Output
- Message indicating whether the point lies inside, on, or outside the circle

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Applications
- Geometry problems
- Computer graphics
- Collision detection

## Conclusion
This program uses basic mathematical calculations to determine the position
of a point relative to a circle in a simple and efficient manner.
