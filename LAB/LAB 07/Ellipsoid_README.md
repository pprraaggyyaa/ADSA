# Volume of an Ellipsoid

## Aim
To calculate the **volume of an ellipsoid** given its three semi-axes
using the mathematical formula.

## Description
This program takes three real numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, which represent
the semi-axes of an ellipsoid.

The volume of the ellipsoid is calculated using the formula:

Volume = (4/3) × π × a × b × c

The computed volume is then displayed to the user.

## Formula Used
- Volume = (4/3) × π × a × b × c

## Input
- Value of `a`
- Value of `b`
- Value of `c`

## Output
- Volume of the ellipsoid

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Applications
- Geometry calculations
- Physics and engineering problems
- Mathematical modeling

## Conclusion
This program demonstrates the application of a mathematical formula in C
to compute the volume of a three-dimensional geometric shape.
