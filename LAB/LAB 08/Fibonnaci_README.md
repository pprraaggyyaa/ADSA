# Fibonacci Series Using Iteration

## Aim
To generate and display the **Fibonacci series** up to a given number of terms
using an iterative approach.

## Description
This program takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` terms
of the Fibonacci series.

The Fibonacci series is defined as:
- First term = 0
- Second term = 1
- Each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms

The program uses a loop to generate the series efficiently.

## Algorithm Used
- Iterative method

## Input
- Number of terms `n`

## Output
- Fibonacci series up to `n` terms

## Language Used
- C Programming

## How to Execute
1. Compile the program:
2. Run the program:

## Applications
- Mathematical computations
- Algorithm analysis
- Computer science fundamentals

## Conclusion
The iterative approach efficiently generates the Fibonacci series with
minimal memory usage and simple logic.
